===========================

The compiler performs 4 distinct actions to build your code

c++ main.cpp
This will build program called a.out


Behind the scene during compilation of a c++ code

1. Pre-process- copy paste files. (Produce main.i)
2. Compile - convert the code into assemby code. (produce main.s)
3. Assembly - The assembly code is then converted into object binary that a computer can understand. (Produce main.o)
4. Linker - 

Building libraries
==========================

libraries: Multiple objects files that are logically connected

Types of Libraries:

static: faster, take a lot of space, become part of the end binary, named: lib*.a (everything that happens at compile time)

Dynamic: Slower, can be copied, references by a program, named lib*.so (everthing that happens at run time)

creat a static library with ar rcs libname.a module.o module.o ....

static libraries are just archives just like zip/tar/...
